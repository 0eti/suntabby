Frotend - Website + Maybe a mobile app.
Backend - Services

Microservice oriented architecture. Going to use a brokered system with RabbitMQ as the message queue

1) Keep backend services independently deployable
2) Provide content that others can learn something from
3) Create a scalable cloud native web app
